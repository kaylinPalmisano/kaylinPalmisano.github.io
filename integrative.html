        <h3>What is Integrative Studies?</h3>
        It is a fairly open ended, flexible program that marries multiple traditional disciplines. I was able to 
        construct my own unique degree based on my two focus areas, math and computer science. 
</p>
      
      <p>
        <h3>Why choose it?</h3>
      I was solely a math major until I took my first programming class and instantly fell in love with computer
      science. This program allowed me to pursue both areas. 
</p>
    
    <p>
        <h3>How did it benefit me?</h3>
    This program taught me to be self-directed, punctual, and entrepreneurial.<br><br>
    Since this is not a preset program, I had to proactively design my degree and justify my selected courses. Additionally,
    the semester long senior (capstone) project was structured differently than traditional programs. I had to design a project that integrated 
    my areas of study, find and select faculty to mentor me through my project, and schedule and maintain regular meetings to 
    discuss the progress and direction of my project.<a href = "/capstone.html"> What is my senior project?</a>
